          <h2>Volunteer</h2>

          <p class="get-involved-paragraf">
            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready
            for visitors to come and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="get-involved-paragraf">
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access
            to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you'd like to find
            out more about how you can get involved.
          </p>
